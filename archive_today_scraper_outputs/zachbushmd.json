            "image-text": "It is quite extraordinary that humanity has failed to establish our society with the understanding of our necessary relation to the organisms that constitute the biology of life on earth.\n\nFrom the earliest moments of birth we are separated from nature, pulled from the womb by gloved hands, sterile hospital equipment, recycled air-conditioned air, plastics, carpets, paints, polyester car seat linings, plastic bottles, rubber soled shoes. \n\nSo rarely do we get engaged with mother nature now. We need to begin to reimagine everything \u2013 technology, products, homes, schools, communities, transportation, in the context of our natural world.\n\nWhat if a product served mother earth before it could serve humanity?\n\nWhat if technologies and architectures were designed by the templates we are provided by nature?\n\nThis is our challenge at this tipping point history of humankind: learn to play within nature\u2026 or leave.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be a part of a mosaic of people speaking to food systems, biodiversity, and why the connection to nature is critical for the health of humanity in a free online event hosted by @patagoniaprovisions along with @PoconoOrganics @foodforever2020 Link in bio to join the conversation starting today, Friday September 25, at 10am ET and running throughout the day.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n#LetsPlantTheSeed #FoodForever #humanhealth #soilhealth #planetaryhealth #mothernature #regeneration #bethechange #allofustogether #newparadigm #regenerativeag #thefutureisnow #zachbushmd",

From another perspective, in 1945 Americans grew 45% of their food in their backyard gardens.  Now we grow 0.1% of our food in our backyards.\n\nWe created this era of chemical mega farms that has led to the destruction of our soils, water systems, oceans, and human health.  By the same reality, we can transform this planet to the most verdant and regenerative ecosystem that has been in many millennia.\n\nBy learning to work in a co-creative process with mother nature and her extraordinary variety of species, farmers and consumers will participate to witness richer soils and more abundance of life and health than has been seen in human history.\n\nIf this conversation is meaningful to you, follow and support the work of @farmersfootprint seeking to catalyze the universal adoption of regenerative practices through amplifying voices of those doing the work on the ground, building  public awareness, expanding accessibility to educational resources, and scaling next generation economic models that support investment in a regenerative future.\n\nWatch the full interview with Josh Trent (@trent_sd) from @WellnessForce at the link in my bio @zachbushmd\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#farmersfootprint #regenerativeagriculture #regen #soilhealth #humanhealth #planetaryhealth #mothernature #regenerativefuture #regeneration #bethechange #allofustogether #newparadigm #regenerativeag #thefutureisnow #zachbushmd",

In this webinar we will look at the role of viruses in the development of life on earth, including the human genome, stem cells, and the adaptation of life.  As we step into the world of the viruses we get a glimpse of the potential for a new philosophy for human society as a member of nature, rather than at war with that nature.

That is the OG checks-and-balances system.\n\nSo check this: Human is not at the center of human health.  The diversity of mother nature is at the center of human health. \n\nWhat does this mean about human consciousness? It seems likely to follow that it also resides outside of the human cellular system\u2026\n\nConnection to nature is our saving grace.\n\nFind your presence in the grandiosity of her beauty, and find yourself.\n\nCheck out our peer-reviewed science on the power of nature to heal us at www.zachbushmd.com link in bio @zachbushmd\n\n.\n.\n.\n#planetaryhealth #mothernature #hugatree #cocreate #regenerativefuture #regeneration #humanhealth #banglyphosate #bethechange #allofustogether #newparadigm #regenerativeag #futurist #biohacking #guthealth #regenerativeag #gutbrainconnection #sustainablefarming #sustainability #guthealth #thefutureisnow #zachbushmd",

            "image-text": "Here's the first time in months that I've heard a clear and concise dissenting voice within the media.\n\u00a0\nIt's unfortunate how little of this we have heard in the United States from our mainstream media channels. I miss the days when investigative journalism was\u00a0a part of the nightly news. I miss the days when content and deep inquiry drew the audience rather than nice haircuts and sexy anchors.\n\nI miss Tom Brokaw, Robert MacNeil, Jim Lehrer, and the voices in the Utne Reader. I miss the jaundiced eye of the BBC journalism. As Clinton signed into effect the legislation that would allow for the media monopolies to start, we were not aware as citizens\u00a0how fast truth would be subject to subterfuge. By 2001 we knew we were in a new era of media coercion and censorship.\n\nIf you get the chance, please walk through what I consider to be the defacto national monument to the free press that is the Chicago Tribune building in Chicago next time you are there. It is overwhelming to me how clear our founding fathers were in their\u00a0understanding of the necessity for a free press at the heart of democracy, and how unaware we have become in recent decades.\n\nLet's look for dissenting voices everywhere just so that we can exercise our conscious mind, and flex our capacity of discernment.\n\nOil companies and pharmaceutical chemical companies are not the most dangerous enemy. A censored and coerced media is.\n\nOur First Amendment, portion as penned by Madison:\n\"The freedom of speech and of the press, and the right of the people peaceably to assemble and consult for their common good, and to apply to the government for redress of grievances, shall not be infringed.\"\n\nIt is time for new governance founded on ancient wisdom.\n\n#freepress #freedomofpress #regenerativefuture #regeneration #humanhealth #bethechange #allofustogether #newparadigm",

The last decade has uncovered discoveries of the vast universe we call the microbiome. Two paradigm shifting conclusions have been ascertained from thousands of research studies: Neither human immunity or the human brain work without the interaction of millions of species of tiny organisms that inhabit every niche of the human body.\n\nThe gut is the Manhattan of the microbiome. Every internal organ; liver, kidneys, vascular system, and brain, have unique ecosystems of viruses, bacteria & fungi that maintain balance & function.\n\nThe foundation of the gut & microbiome in human health cannot be over emphasized.\u00a0 Our lab has been working for 7 years to understand the relationship between the microbiome & integrity of the intestinal lining.\u00a0 Your gut lining, covering two tennis courts in surface area, is only half the thickness of a human hair.\u00a0 This super thin cellophane-like barrier is not a wall, but rather an intelligent gate keeper, allowing the good stuff in, & keeping out unwanted biome, toxins, organic, inorganic toxins, etc.\n\nIn a profoundly eloquent method of checks & balances, mother nature has designed our gut barrier, the primary structure that defines your self-identity at the biologic level, to be completely dependent on its continuous contact with the microbial population of the earth.\u00a0 Through your breath, food & all you touch, your microbiome is an extension of you. If you isolate yourself from nature & her biodiversity, you will falter in your self-identity, immune function, & in your mind.\n\n1 course of antibiotics: shown to increase your risk of major depression by 24%, anxiety disorders by 17%\n\n2 courses of antibiotics in a year: 52% increase in depression & 44% increase in anxiety disorders.\n\nNeither the microbiome\u00a0or the virome are\u00a0against us. The microbiome,\u00a0communicating via\u00a0viruses,\u00a0is\u00a0the origin of biologic\u00a0life &\u00a0the avenue of adaptation\u00a0that makes a biodiverse,\u00a0abundant, resilient earth.
